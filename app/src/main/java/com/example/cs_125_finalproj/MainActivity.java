/** The main activity will contain the labels of terms needed for a first or second linear
 * differential equation. There will be some sort of input to type the coefficients associated
 * with each term. There will also be a place to insert the symbol for the independent variable
 * so that if any other letters are types into the inputs, the application recognizes them as
 * constants. We will need to use some sort of Java math library that deals with calculus so
 * that the math for the coding is easier. There will be a calculate button, that will print
 * the solution to the differential equation.*/
